# NVSolTrace

NVIDIA Optix plugin for PySolTrace, the python bindings for the NLR SolTrace&trade; ray-tracing engine. Must have an NVIDIA GPU to run this code. This just packages the GPU related code seperately from the CPU code, and it will be automatically included if installed.

---

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install pysoltrace[optix]
```

### Verify Installation

```python
import nvsoltrace

print(nvsoltrace.__version__)
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+

---

## Examples

See [SolTrace Examples repository](https://github.com/NLR-SolTrace/SolTrace-Examples) for examples using the OPTIX runner from pysoltrace.

---

## Development

See the main [README](https://github.com/NLR-SolTrace/SolTrace/blob/develop/README.md) for building SolTrace. For nvsoltrace, set both `SOLTRACE_BUILD_API` and `SOLTRACE_BUILD_OPTIX_SUPPORT` CMake options to `ON`.

Navigate to `SolTrace/api`. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests, with the virtual environment activated, navigate to `SolTrace/api` and run:

```bash
python ./testing.py
```

If nvsoltrace is successfully found, the OptixRunner tests will run.

---

## Building from Source

Install build tool. Navigate to `SolTrace/api/nvsoltrace` and run:

```bash
python -m pip install build
python -m build --wheel
```
